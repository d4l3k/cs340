## 1 PageRank

### 1. Hand in your code implementing the random walk algorithm.
```octave
function [ranks] = pagerank(X, alpha, t)
n = rows(unique(X));

adj = zeros(n,n);
ranks = zeros(n,1);

for i = 1:rows(X)
  adj(X(i,1),X(i,2)) = 1;
  adj(X(i,2),X(i,1)) = 1;
end

current = ceil(rand()*n);
for i=1:t
  if rand < alpha
    current = ceil(rand()*n);
  else
    candidates = find(adj(current,:)==1);
    current = candidates(ceil(rand()*columns(candidates)));
  end
  ranks(current) += 1;
end

ranks = ranks./ sum(ranks);
end
```

Code used for answering the questions below:

```octave
load arrowhead.mat

alpha = 0.1;
ranks = pagerank(X, alpha, 1000000);
[largest, i] = max(ranks)
largest = names(i)
med = median(ranks)

names(64)
ranks(64)
```

### 2. Who is the person with the largest PageRank?

The person with the largest page rank is "Golub with a rank of 0.088345.

### 3. If you normalize the PageRanks so that they sum up to 1, what is the median PageRank value?

The median page rank is 0.0077470.

### 4. What is the (normalized) PageRank of the inventor of Matlab?

The page rank of Moler is 0.018057.

## 2 Neural Networks

Changes made:

- Used sigmoid function instead of tanh.
- Use a decreasing step size O(1/sqrt(t))
- Added momentum
- Added basis
- Added L2 regularizer (increased test error)
